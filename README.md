It's a flashcard app (like Anki) focused in Japanese and has features related to look up and search kanji.

I tried my best to make a clean, useful and beautiful design. 

My goal is to make learning vocabulary an easy and fun experience.

## Features
You can:
- Create card collections
- Create/delete new cards
- Make your studies
- Search for kanjis
